                <b>Sippi Arsuang</b> is a hill. Its height is 2939 feet. It is located at Roangchhari in the Bandarban district
                of
                Chittagong Hill Tracts. The names of the hill are different in different indigenous languages. The Bum
                race
                called it Sippi, Tanchanga – Rametang, Marma – Ramatang, Pangkhoa – Arsuang which means rooster crest.
                Also
                called by many names including Ramjum. Sippi is the southernmost peak (left) of the three peaks that can
                be
                seen from Sippi Para. The middle one is Arsuang. The right one has no name. Some also call the survival
                of
                the South Sippi Arsuang. However, whatever the name, this mountain is known to us as Sippy Arsuang.</p>
